# Redwood Mobility Brand Guidelines
## Logo: Broken Orbit

---

## Logo Concept

The Broken Orbit mark evolves from the original tree ring concept, transforming static concentric circles into dynamic, offset rings with strategic gaps. This creates a sense of forward momentum and innovation while maintaining the connection to redwood heritage—growth rings that tell a story of time and permanence.

The center point anchors the mark, representing the core of the business, while the orbiting rings suggest expansion, movement, and the networks Redwood Mobility builds.
